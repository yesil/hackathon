Users benefit from a 'pay-as-you-go' model, purchasing only the content they desire, thus avoiding unwanted subscription commitments. The platform is designed for ease of use, simplifying digital currency interactions, especially for those new to crypto. To encourage initial engagement, new users receive a $1 equivalent in platform-locked BTC.B, usable for trying out content purchases or tipping, providing a simple introduction to digital payments and direct creator support.

Content creators often struggle to directly monetize their exclusive work on social media without facing high platform fees or complex payout systems. For consumers, "subscription fatigue" is a growing concern, making them hesitant to commit to yet another recurring payment for content they may only want to access selectively. Simultaneously, many potential supporters and consumers are hesitant to explore cryptocurrency due to perceived complexity and a lack of tangible, everyday use cases.
